# ThinkOS Chapter 1

**1. Give an example of a feature common in interpreted languages that is rare in compiled languages**

Interpreted languages allow for dynamic typing which means that the type of a variable is assigned during run-time and not while the code is being written

**2. Name two advantages of static typing over dynamic typing**

Firstly, static typing is more efficient at memory allocation because types are defined at the onset. Secondly, the code is easier to read because the types are all declared, and errors that pertain to combining different types are decreased.

**3. Give an example of a static semantic error**

```
int bar = “hello”
```

**4. What are two reasons you might want to turn off code optimization?**

Optimization can introduce bugs into your code during run time, which makes debugging a bit harder, and increases compilation time.

**5. When you run gcc with -S, why might the results look different on different computers?**

Running gcc with -S outputs the assembly code to a file, and the assembly is different based on what hardware you’re using.

**6. If you spell a variable name wrong, or if you spell a function name wrong, the error messages you get might look very different.  Why?**

When something is wrong within the code and a called function or variable doesn’t exist, the errors that appear are because other steps in the compilation process are closely linked to the error is wrong. 

**7. What is a segmentation fault?**

A segmentation fault is a run time error that happens when you try to read or write an incorrect location in memory.
