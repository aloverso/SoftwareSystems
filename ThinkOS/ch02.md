# ThinkOS Chapter 2

**1. Give a real-world example of virtualization (ideally not one of the ones in the book)**

A bank - it might seem like your money is just sitting there in a safebox, that gets added when you deposit and depleted when you withdraw, but in reality, you have no actual pile of cash sitting there - the bank gives you money when you request it, because it knows you “own” it, but nothing is ever just sitting there, the bank loans it out or invests it in other people and you trust it to actually give you your money when you want it.  The system create the illusion that the bank “has” all my money.

Remote-controlled cars - there’s a lot of things going on in RC, but all you need to know is that when you toggle the switch to the left, the car drives left, and you don’t need to worry about how.

**2. What is the difference between a program and a process?**

The process is what the OS cares about - contains the text of a program, but also other data for the machine like the state of the program, the time it started, whether it is paused, etc. A process runs a program (but sometimes a process can start a new program too).

**3. What is the primary purpose of the process abstraction?  What illusion does the process abstraction create?**

Gives the user the illusion that their program is consistently running without interruption. The programmer doesn’t have to worry about scheduling issues since the OS takes care of this. Additionally, the write once run anywhere is made possible because all the device specific modifications to the code can be abstracted away.

**4. What is the kernel?**

It’s the base-level stuff that actually interacts with the hardware.  It’s also the part of the OS responsible for creating threads.

**5. What is a daemon?**

A process that runs in the background and provides operating system services. Users don’t have to interact with daemons as they quietly run in the background, usually a result of kernel processes.
